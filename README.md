# 🚗 Vehicle Speed Monitoring System (VSM) 🚗

## 🌟 Background Information

Road accidents cause around 1.35 million deaths and 50 million injuries globally each year. In Pakistan, the traffic situation is exacerbated by outdated equipment and poor enforcement of traffic laws. This project focuses on developing a Vehicle Speed Monitoring System that can estimate vehicle speeds using CCTV footage, with the aim of preventing accidents and enforcing speed limits.

## 🎯 Significance 

- 🚦 Reducing accidents caused by overspeeding
- 📋 Ensuring compliance with road safety regulations
- 🔄 Improving overall traffic management

By employing modern Computer Vision techniques, this project provides a real-time solution to monitor vehicle speeds and enforce speed limits efficiently.

## 🎓 Aims and Objectives

- 🔍 Detect vehicles in real-time using object detection techniques
- 🏎️ Estimate vehicle speeds accurately
- ⚠️ Generate alerts for speed limit violations (planned for future development)

## 🛠️ Methodology

The project follows these key steps:

1. 📹 Data Collection: CCTV footage is gathered and converted into a usable dataset
2. 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed for analysis
3. 🚙 Object Detection: Vehicles are detected using YOLOv8, a powerful object detection model
4. ⚡ Speed Estimation: The system calculates vehicle speed through pixel subtraction methods and line-passing techniques
5. 🚨 Alert System: In the future, an alert system will be developed to notify users of speed violations
6. 📱 Mobile Application: A mobile app is planned for future development to facilitate easy monitoring and control of the system


## 🚀 Future Work

- 🚨 Alert System: A real-time alert system will be developed to notify users when vehicles exceed the speed limit
- 📱 Mobile Application: A mobile app for Android and iOS will be developed to enable users to monitor the system remotely, providing notifications and real-time data visualization
